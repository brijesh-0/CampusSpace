- *lib/*: This is the core directory where your application's source code resides. All the Dart code for your Flutter app goes here.

 - *screens/*: This folder holds the code for different screens or pages that make up your app's user interface (UI). Each screen is typically represented by a separate Dart file containing the widget tree that builds the UI for that screen.

 - *widgets/*: This folder stores reusable UI components that can be used across different screens in your app. These can be custom widgets you create or pre-built widgets from Flutter's widget library.

 - *services/:* This folder likely contains classes or functions responsible for interacting with external data sources, APIs, or functionalities. These services handle data fetching, manipulation, and communication with other parts of your app.

 - *view_models/:* This folder might hold classes that represent the data models or view models used in your app. View models are often used to manage data displayed on the UI and interact with services. (Note: Some projects might use a different name like models or blocs for this folder depending on the data management approach).

 - *...:* This indicates there could be other folders in your project specific to your app's needs. These might include folders for fonts, styles, configuration, or utility functions.

This structure promotes separation of concerns:

- UI logic is separated in the screens and widgets folders.
- Data handling is handled by the services folder.
- Data models or view models are stored in the view_models folder (or similar).
